## [0.3.3] - 2025-08-25

### üîß Fixed
- **Animation Smoothness**: Fixed breathing animation to properly grow and shrink with breathing phases
  - Corrected exhale figure arrays to maintain consistent small‚Üílarge ordering across all presets
  - Removed overly aggressive intensity scaling that limited animation to 30% of range
  - Reordered smoothing to apply before intensity scaling, preserving full amplitude range
  - Fixed MINIMAL_FIGURES exhale array direction for consistent visual progression
- **Visual Breathing Flow**: Animation now properly shows:
  - Inhale: smooth growth from small ‚Üí medium ‚Üí large icons
