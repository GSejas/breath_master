## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-25

### üéØ Major Animation & Storage Improvements

#### ‚ú® Added
- **Cross-Window Storage Sync**: Implemented versioned storage wrapper with file-based notifications
- **Real-time Multi-Window Updates**: Changes in one VS Code window now sync to all other windows within ~1 second
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: Automatic conflict resolution prevents lost updates when multiple windows modify data
- **Storage Wrapper API**: New `StorageWrapper` class with version control and touch file notifications
- **FileSystemWatcher Integration**: Monitors storage changes across extension hosts

#### üîß Fixed
- **Animation Direction Consistency**: Fixed exhale animations to properly shrink (large ‚Üí small) instead of growing
- **Intensity Scaling**: Removed overly aggressive 0.49 scaling cap that prevented large icons from appearing
- **Smoothing Order**: Apply amplitude smoothing before intensity scaling to preserve full range
- **Index Flicker**: Added low-pass filtering to reduce rapid icon transitions at amplitude boundaries
- **Array Ordering**: Normalized all breathing phase arrays to consistent small‚Üílarge progression

#### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
- **Atomic File Operations**: Touch file writes use temp-file + rename for atomic updates
- **Backward Compatibility**: Automatic detection of storage type maintains compatibility with existing tests
- **Error Resilience**: Touch file failures don't break main functionality
- **Version Conflict Handling**: Retry logic with exponential backoff for storage conflicts

### üß™ Testing & Quality
- **All 76 Unit Tests Passing**: Maintained 100% test compatibility
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Zero compilation errors
- **Mock Storage Detection**: Smart detection distinguishes between test mocks and production storage

### üìÅ Files Changed
- `src/vscode/storage-wrapper.ts` - New versioned storage implementation
- `src/engine/gamification.ts` - Dual-mode storage support with reload capabilities
- `src/engine/onboarding.ts` - Dual-mode storage support with reload capabilities
- `src/vscode/extension.ts` - Integrated storage wrapper and cross-window watcher
- `src/engine/breathe-engine.ts` - Fixed exhale array directions in all presets
