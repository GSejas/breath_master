```

### Typography Voice

#### **Eon's Voice** (Primary Character)
```
Tone: Ancient wisdom meets gentle mentorship
Cadence: Measured, thoughtful, never rushed
Examples:
‚úÖ "Young sapling, let your breath find its natural rhythm..."
‚úÖ "I have watched coding seasons change for millennia..."
‚úÖ "Like branches swaying, release what you hold..."

‚ùå "Hey! Time to breathe!" (too demanding)
‚ùå "Boost your productivity now!" (too commercial)
‚ùå "You haven't meditated today." (too guilt-inducing)
```

#### **Interface Text** (Secondary Voice)
```
Tone: Clear, supportive, never pushy
Style: Soft suggestions, not commands
Examples:
‚úÖ "FlowSeed planted ‚Ä¢ 15m of mindful focus ahead"
‚úÖ "Your practice has grown like ancient rings"
‚úÖ "Gentle invitation: Notice your shoulders..."

‚ùå "You must complete your session!" 
‚ùå "Streak broken - try harder!"
‚ùå "Maximize your meditation points!"
```

### Animation Principles

#### **Natural Motion**
- **Easing**: `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.320, 1)` (gentle, organic curves)
- **Timing**: Slow in, slow out - like natural growth
- **Duration**: 300-800ms - never rushed, never jarring

#### **Tree-Inspired Effects**
```css
/* Gentle branch sway */
@keyframes leafRustle {
  0%, 100% { transform: rotate(-0.5deg); }
  50% { transform: rotate(0.5deg); }
}

/* Growth animation */
@keyframes organicGrow {
  from { 
    opacity: 0; 
    transform: translateY(8px) scale(0.95); 
  }
  to { 
    opacity: 1; 
    transform: translateY(0) scale(1); 
  }
}

/* Breathing pulse */
@keyframes breatheWithEon {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 0.7; }
  50% { opacity: 1; }
}
```

## üìù Content Guidelines

### Messaging Hierarchy
1. **Eon's Wisdom** - Character-driven philosophy and deeper insights
2. **Feature Explanations** - Clear, benefit-focused descriptions  
3. **UI Labels** - Concise, action-oriented text
4. **Micro-copy** - Supportive transitions and confirmations

### Writing Principles

#### **Do:**
- Use nature metaphors naturally (roots, branches, seasons)
- Acknowledge user autonomy ("if you choose", "when ready")
- Frame benefits as growth, not productivity hacking
- Keep technical terms simple but not dumbed-down
- End with gentle invitations, not demands

#### **Don't:**
- Force nature metaphors where they don't fit
- Use guilt or shame for missed sessions
- Promise unrealistic outcomes
- Sound like a productivity guru
- Interrupt with urgent demands

### Example Voice Samples

#### **Feature Introduction:**
```
üå± FlowSeeds
Plant intentions that grow into focused coding sessions. 
Choose a timeframe, tend it with attention, and watch 
your practice deepen naturally.
```

#### **Error/Gentle Correction:**
```
üçÉ This breathing pattern needs four numbers (like 4-4-4-4).
Let's help your rhythm find its proper form.
```

#### **Achievement:**

Five days of mindful practice - Eon nods with ancient approval.

#### **Settings Description:**
