# World & Narrative Layer

A light, optional metaphorical layer: the developer cultivates an inner "Flow Garden" as they progress. Entirely ignorable; never blocks functionality.

## Narrative Beats
| Level | Title | Metaphor Element | Subtle Flavor |
|-------|-------|------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Mindful Rookie | Seed | First breath planted |
| 2 | Breathing Novice | Sprout | Emerging awareness |
| 3 | Calm Coder | Leaf cluster | Rhythm forming |
| 4 | Zen Developer | Young tree | Stability growing |
| 5 | Mindful Master | Canopy | Shade of presence |
| 6 | Breathing Sage | Grove | Shared stillness |
| 7 | Code Mystic | Night sky | Pattern intuition |
| 8 | Breath Master | Constellation | Continuous flow |

## Optional Flavor Surfacing
- Tooltip Easter Eggs: (1 per level, shown once)
- Reflection Prompt (opt-in): e.g. "What did focus feel like today?"
- Garden View (Future): Visual summary (local-only) â€“ not default.

## Copy Style
- Gentle, non-performative
- Avoids competition metaphors
- Uses natural imagery and calm verbs

## Deactivation Principle
Narrative layer auto-hides if user sets `breathMaster.minimalMode = true` (future setting).

---
Narrative should *support* mindfulness, never distract from core breathing utility.
