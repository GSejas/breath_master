# Social Media Assets & DALLE Prompts

## Twitter/X Visual Content

### Tweet 1: Feature Announcement
```dalle
Create a hero image showing the evolution from stressed developer to mindful coder - abstract figures transitioning through meditation states while surrounded by floating code elements that transform from chaotic red error messages to harmonious green success patterns. Include breathing visualization elements and the zen tree motif subtly integrated. Style: inspirational tech presentation art, gradient backgrounds, clean vector elements, suitable for large display.
```

**Copy:** "üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Breath Master brings meditation directly to VS Code. 5 breathing patterns, ethical gamification, privacy-first design. Because better breathing = better code. Demo: resources/0.3.1-full.mp4 #VSCode #DeveloperWellbeing"

### Tweet 2: Technical Thread Starter
```dalle
Design a technical architecture visualization showing data flow through the Breath Master extension - abstract geometric shapes representing the meditation engine, VS Code integration layer, and ethical design principles. Include breathing pattern waveforms, privacy shields, and local-first data symbols. Use developer-friendly color scheme with subtle zen influences. Style: technical documentation illustration meets mindful design, clean and informative.
```

**Thread:** "üßµ How we built ethical gamification for meditation (without corrupting it): 1/7 The 12-PRINCIPLES-ANALYSIS.md became our framework..."

## Instagram Content Strategy

### Story Template
```dalle
Illustrate the concept "VS Code as meditation environment" - show a serene digital landscape where code syntax elements (brackets, functions, variables) float like leaves around a central breathing tree, with gentle waves emanating outward. The tree should echo the existing zen logo design but more ethereal. Include subtle UI elements from code editors integrated harmoniously. Style: digital zen garden meets programming aesthetic, warm earth tones with code syntax highlighting colors.
```

### Carousel Post (3 slides)
1. **Hero Image**: Zen tree logo from `media/breath-master-iconic.png`
2. **Feature Demo**: Screenshot from `resources/gif-animation-vscode.gif`  
3. **CTA**: Custom DALLE ethical design visualization

## YouTube Thumbnail Options

### Option 1: Dramatic Before/After
```dalle
Split screen dramatic comparison - left side shows chaotic code editor filled with red error messages, stressed developer silhouette, dark oppressive atmosphere; right side shows same scene but with calm blue-green meditation indicators, peaceful developer, zen tree elements integrated into the interface. Large text overlay space reserved for "MEDITATION IN VS CODE". Style: YouTube thumbnail aesthetic, high contrast, attention-grabbing.
```

### Option 2: Technical Deep Dive
```dalle
Technical cutaway diagram showing VS Code with meditation system layers - transparent overlay showing breathing engine, gamification ethics, habit formation loops, all rendered in clean isometric style with VS Code's signature colors. Include subtle data visualization elements. Style: educational tech content thumbnail, clean and professional.
```

## Conference/Presentation Visuals

### Title Slide Background
```dalle
Abstract representation of consciousness meeting code - flowing neural networks transforming into code syntax, breathing rhythms becoming waveform patterns, all centered around a stylized tree of life that connects digital and organic elements. Use presentation-friendly color gradients suitable for large screens. Style: keynote presentation background, professional yet inspiring.
```

### Architecture Slide
Use existing: `12-PRINCIPLES-ANALYSIS.md` framework diagram + custom DALLE enhancement:

```dalle
Create a modern presentation diagram showing the 12 ethical principles as interconnected nodes in a network, with data flow arrows showing how user control, privacy, and dignity principles connect. Include subtle meditation and VS Code UI elements. Use clean, business-presentation color scheme with excellent readability. Style: corporate tech presentation, professional infographic.
```
