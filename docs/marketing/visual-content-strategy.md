- Perfect for: Social media avatars, article headers, marketplace listings

### Demo Assets  
- **`resources/`** contains rich video content:
  - `0.3.1-full.mp4` - Complete feature demonstration
  - `0.3.1-session-full.mp4` - Full meditation session walkthrough  
  - `0.3.1-session.mp4` - Condensed session demo
  - `0.3.1-stretch.mp4` - Stretch presets in action
  - Multiple GIFs showing animation modes and VS Code integration

## Strategic DALLE Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Dev.to Article Headers

```dalle
Create a minimalist, abstract visualization showing a developer's mind state during coding - split screen with chaotic geometric fragments on left representing stress/bugs, and flowing organic curves on right representing calm focus after meditation. Use VS Code's dark theme colors (dark blue #1e1e1e, accent blue #007acc) with warm breathing colors (soft oranges, gentle greens). Style: clean vector art meets zen illustration, suitable for technical blog header, no text needed.
```

### 2. LinkedIn Professional Post Visual

```dalle
Design a sophisticated infographic showing the neuroscience of coding and meditation - abstract brain silhouette in VS Code blue with neural pathways lighting up, breathing pattern waveforms flowing through the brain, small UI elements suggesting code editor interface. Include subtle data visualization elements showing productivity metrics. Style: modern tech infographic meets scientific illustration, professional color palette of blues, whites, and soft accent colors.
```

### 3. Hacker News Discussion Starter

```dalle
Create a technical diagram visualization of VS Code status bar integration - show a stylized IDE interface with glowing meditation indicators, breathing phase animations, and subtle gamification elements. Include abstract representations of habit formation loops and neural pathways. Use monospace font aesthetics and terminal colors (green text on dark background) with gentle meditation accent colors. Style: technical schematic meets zen design philosophy.
```

### 4. Social Media Engagement Visual

```dalle
Illustrate the concept "VS Code as meditation environment" - show a serene digital landscape where code syntax elements (brackets, functions, variables) float like leaves around a central breathing tree, with gentle waves emanating outward. The tree should echo the existing logo design but more ethereal. Include subtle UI elements from code editors integrated harmoniously. Style: digital zen garden meets programming aesthetic, warm earth tones with code syntax highlighting colors.
```

### 5. Conference/Presentation Visual

```dalle
Create a hero image showing the evolution from stressed developer to mindful coder - abstract figures transitioning through meditation states while surrounded by floating code elements that transform from chaotic red error messages to harmonious green success patterns. Include breathing visualization elements and the zen tree motif subtly integrated. Style: inspirational tech presentation art, gradient backgrounds, clean vector elements, suitable for large display.
```

### 6. GitHub README Enhancement

```dalle
Design a technical architecture visualization showing data flow through the Breath Master extension - abstract geometric shapes representing the meditation engine, VS Code integration layer, and ethical design principles. Include breathing pattern waveforms, privacy shields, and local-first data symbols. Use developer-friendly color scheme with subtle zen influences. Style: technical documentation illustration meets mindful design, clean and informative.
```

## Content Enhancement Strategy

### Article Headers
- **Building Wellness Extension**: Use existing tree logo with DALLE header visual
- **Psychology of Coding**: Custom DALLE neuroscience infographic
- Add video thumbnails from `resources/` for embedded demos

### Social Media
- **LinkedIn**: Professional DALLE infographic + tree logo watermark
- **Twitter**: Animated GIF from resources + custom quote cards
- **Instagram**: Zen-tech aesthetic posts using DALLE art + logo

### Technical Documentation  
- **README**: DALLE architecture diagram + existing demo videos
- **12-PRINCIPLES doc**: Custom ethical design visualization
- **API docs**: Clean technical illustrations

```

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Impact**: Article headers and LinkedIn visuals
2. **Medium Impact**: Social media engagement posts  
3. **Low Impact**: Technical documentation enhancements

Each DALLE prompt is designed to complement the existing zen tree aesthetic while adding modern tech credibility and visual storytelling that pure ASCII art cannot achieve.

## Style Consistency Notes

The existing logo suggests:
- **Warm, organic colors** (earth tones, gentle greens)
- **Concentric circle motifs** (breathing ripples)
- **Zen aesthetics** meeting **tech functionality**
- **Minimal, iconic design** that scales well

All DALLE images should echo these design principles while adding contemporary tech visualization elements.
